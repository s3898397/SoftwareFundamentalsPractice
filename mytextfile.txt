Would you like to hear a joke?


Alright, three men walked into a bar. The first man was a pirate. The second man was a black pirate and the third man was a bird. The black pirate said the pirate that he was thirsty. This made the pirate order a mug of beer for his lassy. But the bird repeated his order making them order two drinks.

And I can't be bothered thinking any more.
