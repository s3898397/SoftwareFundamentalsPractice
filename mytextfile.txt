Would you like to hear a joke?


Alright, three men walked into a bar. The first man was a pirate. The second man was a black pirate and the third man was a bird. The black pirate said the pirate that he was thirsty. This made the pirate order a mug of beer for his lassy. But the bird repeated his order making them order two drinks.

And I can't be bothered thinking any more.

The project Managenement triangle is a concept on project management that tells us about the quality of the product.

Scope is the functional elements that make up the project deliverables
Time is the time allocated to produce these deliverables.
Cost is the amount of money which is required to implement the project.

If you increase one of them, the other three elements will be required to be adjusted.
For example, if you increase the scope, you must allocate more money and time to increase the quality of the product.

The disadvantages of waterfall are that we cannot easily transition back to the previous stages since the project stages were so large.

1. Individuals and Interactions rather than processes and tools.
	- Team work is dream work.
2. Development of working software
	- Software delivery is more prioritized than documentation.
3. Collaboration with the customer or client.
	- Communication with customer for their wants is key. And clarification for customer is key
4. Quickly Responding to change.
	- Small projects allow us to be able to iterate, and change easier.

The advantages of agility are that we have increase product quality due to to prioritization of teamwork, customer communication. But we also have increased cost.
